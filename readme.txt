Create a jQuery-driven rotating image sidebar widget.

== Description ==

Gives you the option of adding a Javascript-powered fading image gallery as a sidebar widget.  The widget pulls its images from previous posts and automatically re-sizes them for display in the appropriate area.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the entire `rotating-image-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the 'Rotating Image Widget' to your sidebar

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many of these widgets can I have on a page? =

The widget itself will allow for multiple instances in a sidebar, but we recommend you stick to just one.  Each widget will pull images from the same location, so having multiple widgets running at once doesn't give you anthing extra.  However, if you have multiple sidebars, feel free to use a widget in each in different locations.

= I use large images on my site that won't fit in the sidebar ... =

That's fine.  The widget will automatically re-size the images to fit inside your sidebar.  This way the user's browser isn't forced to download multiple large images.
